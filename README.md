I’m Syed Mukarram Ali, Founder & Managing Director at DevZylo, where I lead a talented in-house team delivering custom mobile apps, web platforms, and game solutions for clients worldwide. With 9+ years of experience in development and project management, I’ve grown from a hands-on Unity developer into a project delivery expert, team leader, and client success advocate.

Before founding DevZylo, I built my career as a Unity developer, working on 2D/3D, multiplayer, and AR/VR games for global clients. Over the years, I’ve delivered 400+ projects across industries, scaling from freelance work to managing full development teams.

What I do best:
* Project Delivery – Managing full lifecycles from onboarding to launch with clear communication and smooth execution.
* Team Leadership – Building scalable workflows, mentoring developers, and ensuring quality at every stage.
* Client Success – Creating long-term partnerships through transparency, reliability, and measurable results.

At DevZylo, we specialize in:
* Mobile & Web Applications (iOS, Android, Cross-platform)
* Game Development (Unity 2D/3D, Multiplayer, AR/VR)
* Custom Solutions tailored to business needs

I’m passionate about turning complex ideas into polished digital products that deliver real value. Let’s connect if you’re looking for a trusted partner to bring your vision to life.
